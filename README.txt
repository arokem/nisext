nisext

This was a separate repository for the nipy_ setup extensions.  We originally
pulled a copy of this repository into the various nipy projects, using the git
sub-tree merge strategy.  In the end that got to be annoying, so we now just use
the copy of nisext that comes with nibabel_.

In summary, if you want the *nisext* code, please look for it in nibabel_ - the
``nisext`` subdirectory.
